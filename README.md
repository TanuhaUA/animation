# Animation practice

## 1. Make 2 animations from [page](https://html5book.ru/css3-animation/)
* Don't look animation code
* Think about construction of animation and how it works
* You can talk to each other about your ideas
* If you get stuck, ask your colleagues about your problem
* Ask your coach about your problem
* And now, you can look animation code

## 2. Create modal window with animation
* [Modal window example](https://tanuhaua.github.io/modal-window-animation/public)
* Use SCSS, BEM
* Modal window should be responsive
